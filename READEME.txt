Instrument Name: Kalimba

Brief: At its core, Kalimba is a digital emulation of a hand piano that my mom bought me at a local artists shop in Providence, Rhode Island. It was not made by a professional, so has strange resonance and slightly detuned quality. I believe these imperfections add a sense of nostalgia and comfort. The additional effects in this instrument allow for the artist to control the timbre of the sound and also to expand a simple hand piano pluck into a huge, textural, ambient soundscape.
