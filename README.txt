Instrument Name: Kalimba
Creator: Thomas Garvey

Brief: At its core, Kalimba is a digital emulation of a hand piano that my mom bought me at a local artists shop in Providence, Rhode Island. It was not made by a professional, so has strange resonance and slightly detuned quality. I believe these imperfections add a sense of nostalgia and comfort. The additional effects in this instrument allow for the artist to control the timbre of the sound and also to expand a simple hand piano pluck into a huge, textural, ambient soundscape. This instrument should be used by musicians looking to include a faithful adaption of a hand piano in their tracks and sound designers hoping to add expansive ambient soundscapes.

Installation: 
1. If downloading from github, type this command in command line: [git clone https://github.com/tgarvs/Kalimba.git]
2. Drag Kalimba repository into uninitialized instance of DecentSampler OR go into Kalimba folder and double click "Kalimba.dspreset"
3. Navigate through presets using DecentSampler dropdown menu

Sampling & Processing: Virtual instrument includes samples recorded on an XY  microphone placement of two Rode NT5 condensor mics. Four velocity layers of samples are used for both notes played using my thumb pad (softer sound) and my thumb nail (brighter sound).

Controls Overview (all controls are changed using DecentSampler standard knobs - click and drag vertically to change levels):
1. Reverb - Convolution reverb that ranges from small spaces, big spaces, and strange spaces. Use the dropdown menu to explore!
2. Convolution - Same controls are above reverb, but instead of IR's, this function contains audio (.wav) clips. Blend these in to discover really interesting and experimental soundscape designs.
3. Nail - Blends the samples played with nail into the default thumb pad samples. Provides extra brightness and energy  to the instrument in a subtle way.
4. Low Pass - Standard lowpass filter with frequency and resonance control.
5. Envelope - Standard ADSR envelope. Very useful for changing sound into long drones or short staccato pricks. 
6. Delay - Feedback delay with stereo offset. Controls include wet level, delay time, feedback amount, and level of offset between right and left stereo channels.
7. Chorus
